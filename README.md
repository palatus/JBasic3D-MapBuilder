# JBasic3D-MapBuilder

This project was an adaptation from a basic but inefficient 3D framework provided by JavaTutorials101.

Here is the repo for the original code
https://github.com/javatutorials101/Tutorials

The project was turned into an editor of sorts, and into a basic 3D tile based sim with a lighting system.

Again, the program contains many large files, so the following dropbox link should contain the source code.
